Animal GO is a gameified social network for people that come across animals while exploring, where they can share their pictures on our site and interact with other people's posts.
The website makes use of a interactive map where you can explore the earth and discover what animals people around the world come across.
We have incorporated some gameified features, like a EXP system and leaderboards, into our website.
Like, comment and follow other people's content!
